Escape the Lava is a 2D platformer built with Python and Pygame where the player jumps between platforms to reach a green door at the top while escaping rising lava. Along the way, players must dodge spinning saws, moving hazards, and cannon projectiles. The game features three levels of increasing difficulty, a lives system, smooth camera movement, and simple yet fast-paced gameplay focused on timing, reflexes, and platforming precision.

Controls: Space to jump, A and D to move side to side
